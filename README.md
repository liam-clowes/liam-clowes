Hey, my name is **Liam Clowes** 👋

I am a Data Analyst, Project Manager and Localisation Specialist based in Berlin, Germany. I have a Bachelor’s degree in Linguistics & Modern Languages, and have completed further studies in Data Analytics.

I really enjoy connecting with people over insights, learning new skills and sharing my expertise. Over the years, I’ve worked in life sciences, travel tech and ed tech with a goal of helping companies improve end user experience and reach broader audiences.
